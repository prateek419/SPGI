 I'm sharing code that generates several CSV files as output. I created these files at different stages to verify that the code at each step is working as desired.
 The final output from yield_enhanced_index_weighted is later manually compiled into a single file.
 To run the code:
 Place both attachments in the same directory (universe.csv sent over mail)
 Install the required libraries with the following command: pip install pandas numpy cvxpy matplotlib
